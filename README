MongoWSAT

An ASP.NET MVC project with a pre-configured admin section using MongoDB Membership and Role Providers.


Motivation:

The goal of this project is to create a quick way to administer users for ASP.NET MVC websites running against MongoDB.

ASP.NET MVC sites can use ASP.NET pages without issue so Hunzonian's MyWSAT Website Starter Kit offers a great way to get up and running quickly. The problem is that the latest version of MyWSAT is very closely tied to SQL Server and it would be too much work to convert.  Therefore an older version of the WSAT Starter Kit was used instead.
