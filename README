MongoWSAT

An ASP.NET Web Site Administration Tool with MongoDB Membership and Role Providers.


Rationale:

The original goal of this project was to use the MyWSAT Website Starter Kit code located here:
http://mywsat.codeplex.com/
...but running against a MongoDB backend. It became quickly apparent that the latest version of MyWSAT is very closely tied to SQL Server (read: too much work to convert). Therefore an older version of Hunzonian's WSAT Starter Kit was used instead. Much of the functionality remains the same but the style of the administration site is not quite as nice.


License:

The WSAT code is largely unchanged from Hunzonian's original version and retains the original LGPL license.

* NOTE: The MongoProviders.UnitTests project is GPL since it is a port of the Unit Tests from the MySQL Connector project (GPL).
The reason the rest of this project can remain non-GPL'd is due to the FOSS exception as described here:
http://www.mysql.com/about/legal/licensing/foss-exception/
If you are going to include MongoWSAT in a non-open source project then you _must_ remove the MongoProviders.UnitTests project to remain compliant with the MySQL Connector license.

All other code, including the MongoDB Providers are licensed under the MIT License.

All dependencies are included but you may wish to refresh with NuGet to get the latest versions.
